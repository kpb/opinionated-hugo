# Installation

[Hugo][hugo] has excellent [installation instructions][hugo-install] for your platform. I use Linux and find it easiest
to download the [latest release][hugo-release] directly from [Github][github].

Whatever method you use, you should be able to run the `hugo` command:

```bash
$ hugo version
hugo v0.120.4-f11bca5fec2ebb3a02727fb2a5cfb08da96fd9df linux/amd64 BuildDate=2023-11-08T11:18:07Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
```

Note: file paths and commands are shown using Linux format `/`, so modify for Windows if needed `\`.
