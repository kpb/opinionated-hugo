# Installation

[Hugo][hugo] has excellent [installation instructions][hugo-install] for your platform. I use Linux and find it easiest
to download prebuilt binaries from the [GitHub][github] [latest release][hugo-release] page. I recommend installing the so-called
_extended version_.

Whatever method you use, you should be able to run the `hugo` command:

```bash
$ hugo version
hugo v0.147.9-29bdbde19c288d190e889294a862103c6efb70bf+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=2025-06-23T08:22:20Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
```

_Note_: file paths and commands are shown using Linux format `/`, modify for Windows if needed `\`.
